            | Holds a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, but through his prescience powers saw that a great calamity would befall humanity. The only way to avoid such a disaster would be to become a full stack JavaScript developer, so he retreated to a desolated land known as &ldquo;the east bay&rdquo; and he trained himself in the secret arts of JavaScript, prototype inheritance, Angularjs, and the dreaded art of asynchronous callback.
            | A MEAN (Mongodb, Express, Angularjs, Node.js) stack developer, in his spare time he likes to run NodeSchool meetups so that others would not have to go through the long and dangerous path to Node-vana in the same isolation and desolation that he did. So say we all.
